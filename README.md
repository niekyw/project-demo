# Reaction Time Tester
A reaction time tester using Flask and Firebase, made as an individual project demonstration for students of the Middle East Entrepreneurs of Tomorrow program.

This web app is only made using only foundational knowledge learned during Y1 and Y2 of the program (and not including APIs or other optional sections). Some code is intentionally inefficient, to show that you don't need to know advanced programming to make something cool.
